Notes: Short answer: **Option 2 (Caddy’s internal CA) is a very common approach and it’s safe**—as long as you 1) keep the CA private key safe and 2) install the CA certificate on every client you use. It’s exactly what many homelab folks do for pretty internal hostnames without exposing anything to the internet.

Below is how to make your setup solid with your Docker Compose.

---

## Why the warning appears

Your browser doesn’t trust Caddy’s **private CA** yet. Once you install Caddy’s **root CA certificate** on your devices, the warning disappears and you’ll have normal, padlocked HTTPS.

**Security-wise:**

- Traffic stays inside Tailscale (WireGuard) + TLS from your Caddy.
- The only extra “risk” vs. public Let’s Encrypt is **CA management**. If someone steals your CA private key, they could mint bogus certs for your internal domains. Protect the `/data` volume.

---

## Your Compose looks almost right

```yaml
services:
  caddy:
    image: caddy:alpine
    restart: always
    container_name: caddy
    volumes:
      - caddy_certs:/certs # (not strictly used by official image)
      - caddy_config:/config # runtime config / admin API (optional)
      - caddy_data:/data # <-- PERSIST THIS (stores the internal CA)
      - caddy_sites:/srv # web root if you serve files
      - /mnt/ssd/caddy:/etc/caddy:ro # Caddyfile & site configs (RO is fine)
    network_mode: "host"

volumes:
  caddy_certs:
  caddy_config:
  caddy_data:
  caddy_sites:
```

Key point: **`caddy_data:/data` must be persistent**. That’s where Caddy keeps its internal CA (`/data/caddy/pki/...`). If you wipe it, Caddy will generate a _new_ CA and you’ll have to reinstall trust on clients.

---

## Example Caddyfile (with internal CA)

Put this in `/mnt/ssd/caddy/Caddyfile`:

```caddyfile
# For each internal hostname you use via Pi-hole DNS → Tailscale IP:
service1.homelab.ansh.com {
  tls internal
  encode zstd gzip
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
}

service2.homelab.ansh.com {
  tls internal
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:9000
}
```

Notes:

- Keep using Pi-hole to resolve `*.homelab.ansh.com` to the **Tailscale IP** of your Ubuntu box.
- Make sure your client actually visits `https://service1.homelab.ansh.com` (hostname must match the cert’s SAN).

---

## Export the CA cert and trust it on your devices

1. **Copy the CA certificate out of the container**
   After Caddy has started once (so the CA exists):

```bash
docker cp caddy:/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt ./caddy-rootCA.crt
```

2. **Install on each client** (one-time per device)

- **Ubuntu/Debian:**

  ```bash
  sudo cp caddy-rootCA.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/caddy-rootCA.crt
  sudo update-ca-certificates
  ```

- **macOS:** Open _Keychain Access_ → _System_ → _Certificates_ → Import `caddy-rootCA.crt` → set **Always Trust**.
- **Windows:** _mmc_ → _Certificates (Computer)_ → _Trusted Root Certification Authorities_ → _Certificates_ → _Import_.
- **Android:** Settings → Security → Encryption & credentials → Install a certificate → **CA certificate**.
- **iOS/iPadOS:** AirDrop/email file → install profile → Settings → General → About → **Certificate Trust Settings** → enable full trust.

Restart the browser. The warning should be gone.

## Good practices (Option 2)

- **Back up** `caddy_data` volume (especially `/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/`). If you ever rebuild the host, restoring this keeps the same CA—no need to re-trust clients.
- **Restrict access** to the Docker host and volumes; don’t share the `/data` volume with other containers.
- Consider running Caddy as non-root inside Docker (the official image already does), and keep `network_mode: host` only if you really need host ports.
- Keep system **time** correct on both server and clients (TLS validity matters).

---

## Is it “safe”?

Yes—on a Tailnet, with a trusted internal CA, this is safe and widely used. Your threat model mainly becomes:

- **CA compromise** → protect the `/data` volume and backups.
- **DNS poisoning inside your LAN/Tailnet** → Pi-hole and Tailscale help here; you can also pin hostnames in bookmarks to avoid typos.

If you ever want no CA management at all, move to **Option 3** later (Let’s Encrypt via DNS-01). But for now, Option 2 is perfectly fine and costs nothing.

If you’d like, paste your actual Caddyfile hostnames/ports and I’ll tailor it (and double-check your Pi-hole records) so it works first try.

Got it — since you’re already connected to your Ubuntu server over **Tailscale** from your Mac, you can transfer the file securely. Here are a few easy options:

---

### 1. Using `scp` (secure copy)

The simplest way is with `scp`, which works like `cp` but over SSH.

On your **Mac terminal**, run:

```bash
scp homelab@<tailscale-ip>:/home/homelab/caddy-rootCA.crt ~/Downloads/
```

- Replace `homelab` with your Ubuntu username.
- `<tailscale-ip>` is the Tailscale IP.
- The file will be copied into your **Downloads** folder on your Mac.

You’ll be prompted for your Ubuntu user’s password unless you’ve set up SSH keys.

---

### 2. Using `rsync` (if installed)

This is helpful if you’ll need to sync multiple files later:

```bash
rsync -avz homelab@<tailscale-ip>:/home/homelab/caddy-rootCA.crt ~/Downloads/
```

---

### 3. If you want drag-and-drop (optional)

You can also mount the Ubuntu home directory on macOS with `sshfs`:

1. Install with Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install macfuse sshfs
   ```

2. Mount the remote folder:

   ```bash
   sshfs homelab@<tailscale-ip>:/home/homelab ~/mnt/ubuntu
   ```

3. Then browse and drag the file like it’s local.

✅ Recommended: Start with **`scp`** — it’s fast and requires nothing extra.
